// Outscal (www.outscal.com) Admission Coding Challenge 
// Language prefered is C++ (if you are new to C++ / OOPs programming, 
// please watch the Youtube videos shared along with this assignment to learn the basics)
// Alternative languages that you can choose - Java, Python, C# (if you are familiar with them)
// If you choose a different language you can click the "new repl" button in the top right corner 
// of the screen and choose the language of your choice to implement your solution.

// Submission Process - 
// 1. Click "Fork" button at the top of this page if you are using C++ for the assignment
//    (for any other language - refer to the instructions at the top of the page)
// 2. Right your code and test it, make sure it runs as expected 
// 3. Once complete please submit open this link http://bit.ly/2H0yEG9 and submit the google form
// (Note: please do not share with us text/zip files/attachments to showcase your solution)

//Calculator Problem
//This program takes an arithmetic operator +, -, *, / and two inputs from the user. 
//Then, it performs the calculation on the two inputs depending upon the operator entered by the user.
//   +  2+2=4 ;  
//   -  3-1=2 ;
//   *  4*3=12;
//   /  10/5=2;  
//Extra points for applying extra checks (hint: for division operation)
